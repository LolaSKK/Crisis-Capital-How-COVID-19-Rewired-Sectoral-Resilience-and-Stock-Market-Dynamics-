# Crisis-Capital-How-COVID-19-Rewired-Sectoral-Resilience-and-Stock-Market-Dynamics

This project investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. stock market, with a focus on sector-level divergence, 
volatility dynamics, and overall market resilience from 2019 to 2025.

Originally completed as a group project for **STA 141B (Data & Web Technologies for Data Analysis)** at UC Davis. I was responsible for data transformation and sector-level analysis, which includes:
- Structuring and cleaning stock data using pandas and yfinance.
- Analyzing sectoral divergence in market returns pre- and post-COVID
- Measuring and interpreting volatility using 30-day rolling standard deviations

The final report is available in [STA141B+Final+Project+LolaS+LuqiW.pdf](myLib/STA141B+Final+Project+LolaS+LuqiW.pdf)

All relevant code and output are included in the following file:
- [results.ipynb](myLib/results.ipynb)
- [results.pdf](myLib/results.ipynb)

All data was retried using the 'yfinance' library in Jupyter Notebook and processed for this project.

## Project Overview
- Analyzed historical stock price data retrived via 'yfinance', covering S&P 500 sectors before and after the COVID-19 outbreak.
- Led **model structuring**, **data transformation**, and **result interpretations**.
- Focused on visualizing macro market recovery, sector-specific shifts, and volatility variations.
- Presented findings through graphs and descriptive analysis.

## Tools & Methods
- **Language:** Python (Jupyter Notebook - via Anaconda)
- **Packages:** 'pandas', 'numpy', 'matplotlib.pyplot', 'seaborn', 'yfinance'

## Attribution
This project was completed collaboratively as part of an academic assignment for **STA141B (Data & Web Technologies for Data Analysis)** at UC Davis.
