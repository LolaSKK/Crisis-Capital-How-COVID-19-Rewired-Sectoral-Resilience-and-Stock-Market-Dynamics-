# Crisis-Capital-How-COVID-19-Rewired-Sectoral-Resilience-and-Stock-Market-Dynamics

This project investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. stock market, with a focus on sector-level divergence, 
volatility dynamics, and overall market resilience from 2019 to 2025.

All data was retrived using the 'yfinance' library in Jupyter Notebook and processed for this project.

Originally completed as a group project for **STA 141B (Data & Web Technologies for Data Analysis)** at UC Davis. I was responsible for data transformation and sector-level analysis, which includes:
- Structuring and cleaning stock data using pandas and yfinance.
- Analyzing sectoral divergence in market returns pre- and post-COVID
- Measuring and interpreting volatility using 30-day rolling standard deviations

The final report is available in [STA141B+Final+Project+LolaS+LuqiW.pdf](myLib/STA141B+Final+Project+LolaS+LuqiW.pdf)
